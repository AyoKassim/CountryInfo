# CountryInfo
React project developed with Nextjs, with an Express backend


## Steps to Install and Run
(The build branch is the safest branch to use locally due to changes made in the main branch)

In your terminal of choice, create a folder and cd into that folder

Downnload zip file, and extracr files into the created folder

Using the terminal, cd into countryfrontend and run npm install to install dependencies

Open another terminal and cd into server and run npm install to install required dependencies

Run npm start to start the server then in a web browser, go to localhost:9000

In the terminal that was used to cd into countryfrontend, run npm run dev to start the project, and then in another tab, to localhost:3000

The project should run and allow you to search contries, and on the server if you refresh thr url with localhost:9000/countryinfo, it should update with your current search
